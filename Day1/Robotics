1. Real-Time Control

Simple: AI makes quick decisions to control machines instantly.
Technical: It applies reinforcement learning and sensor-driven feedback loops to dynamically adjust actions in real-time systems.
Real-world Example: Autonomous drones avoiding obstacles.
Technical Example: A PID controller stabilizing a robotic arm.


2. Planning

Simple: Planning helps AI decide the best actions to reach a goal.
Technical: AI planning uses algorithms like A* and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to find optimal decision sequences.
Real-world Example: Google Maps finding the shortest route.
Technical Example: A reinforcement learning agent optimizing warehouse inventory restocking.


3. Ethical Considerations

Simple: AI should be fair, safe, and respect privacy.
Technical: Ethical AI involves bias mitigation, explainability, data privacy (GDPR compliance), and alignment with human values.
Real-world Example: Preventing biased hiring decisions in AI-based HR tools.
Technical Example: Differential privacy techniques protecting user data in AI training models.
