1. Image Processing

Simple: Image processing allows computers to edit, enhance, and analyze images.
Technical: It involves operations like filtering, edge detection, and feature extraction using OpenCV, deep learning, or classical image processing techniques.
Real-world Example: Instagram filters enhancing photos.
Technical Example: Gaussian blur reducing noise in medical imaging.


2. Object Detection

Simple: Object detection finds and labels objects in images or videos.
Technical: It combines CNNs and region-based approaches (like YOLO, Faster R-CNN) to detect and classify multiple objects in real time.
Real-world Example: Self-driving cars detecting pedestrians.
Technical Example: YOLOv8 detecting traffic signs in a video stream.


3. Image Segmentation

Simple: Segmentation divides an image into different meaningful parts.
Technical: It categorizes each pixel in an image using deep learning architectures like U-Net and Mask R-CNN.
Real-world Example: Medical imaging to identify tumors in MRI scans.
Technical Example: Semantic segmentation classifying different regions of a satellite image.
