Foundations of AI

Definitions and Historical Context:

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating machines that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. Historically, AI began with early rule-based systems and symbolic methods in the mid‑20th century and has evolved through successive phases—including machine learning and deep learning—driven by advancements in computing power and data availability.

Overview of AI Subfields and Real‑World Applications:  

AI is an umbrella term encompassing several specialized fields:

- Machine Learning: Algorithms that allow systems to learn from data.

- Deep Learning: Neural networks with multiple layers that model complex patterns.

- Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Techniques enabling computers to understand and generate human language.

- Computer Vision: Methods for interpreting and processing visual information.


These subfields power real‑world applications such as autonomous vehicles, medical diagnostics, intelligent personal assistants, and recommendation systems.


Impact on Modern Technology and Society:  

AI is transforming industries by automating complex tasks, enhancing decision‑making, and driving innovation across sectors. Its integration into everyday technology has reshaped how we work, communicate, and solve problems, making it a pivotal force in modern society.
