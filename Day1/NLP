1. Text Processing

Simple: Text processing helps computers read, clean, and analyze written language.
Technical: It involves tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and vectorization to convert raw text into structured data for NLP tasks.
Real-world Example: Auto-correct in smartphones.
Technical Example: TF-IDF vectorization for keyword extraction in search engines.


2. Sentiment Analysis

Simple: Sentiment analysis detects emotions in text, like positive, negative, or neutral opinions.
Technical: It applies NLP and ML techniques (e.g., BERT, LSTMs) to classify sentiment by analyzing word embeddings and context.
Real-world Example: Analyzing customer reviews for product feedback.
Technical Example: A fine-tuned BERT model classifying tweets as happy, sad, or angry.


3. Language Models

Simple: Language models help AI understand and generate human-like text.
Technical: They predict word sequences using probabilistic methods (n-grams) or deep learning architectures (transformers).
Real-world Example: ChatGPT generating text responses.
Technical Example: GPT-4 completing an incomplete sentence based on context.
