## Objectives

- **Understand the Fundamentals of AI:**
  - Learn what Artificial Intelligence is and its historical evolution.
  - Familiarize yourself with key AI subfields such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, Robotics, and Decision Making.
  - Explore real‑world applications of AI.

- **Set Up Your Development Environment:**
  - Install Python and essential libraries.
  - Set up Jupyter Notebook (or an alternative like VSCode) for code experimentation.
  - Install Git and configure version control to manage your projects.

## Daily Tasks

1. **Watch an Introductory Video:**
   - View an "AI for Everyone" video (e.g., by Andrew Ng) to get a broad overview of AI concepts.

2. **Write a Summary:**
   - Compose a 200–300‑word summary explaining what AI is, and list at least three real‑world applications.

3. **Set Up Your Tools:**
   - Install Python, Jupyter Notebook (or your preferred IDE), and Git.
   - Verify your installations by running a basic Python script that prints "Hello, AI!".

4. **Documentation:**
   - Create and maintain a personal notebook documenting your learning progress and any setup challenges.
