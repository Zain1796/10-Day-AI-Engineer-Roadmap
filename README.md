# 10-Day AI Engineer Roadmap

Welcome to the **10-Day AI Engineer Roadmap** repository! This repository is designed for aspiring AI engineers looking to rapidly refresh, build, and showcase their skills. Whether you’re revising your education or preparing for a job interview, this intensive 10‑day plan provides a structured learning path that covers everything from foundational mathematics and programming to deep learning, domain specialization, and final project development.

---

## Overview

This roadmap is split into 10 days, with each day focusing on essential topics and hands‑on assignments:

- **Day 1: Introduction to AI & Environment Setup**  
  - Overview of AI concepts, history, and real‑world applications.  
  - Setting up your development environment (Python, Jupyter Notebook, Git).

- **Day 2: Mathematics Essentials for AI**  
  - Fundamentals of linear algebra, calculus, and probability.  
  - Practice problems to solidify your mathematical foundations.

- **Day 3: Machine Learning Fundamentals**  
  - Key algorithms in supervised and unsupervised learning.  
  - Building and evaluating simple models using scikit‑learn.

- **Day 4: Data Manipulation & Visualization**  
  - Working with NumPy and pandas for data processing.  
  - Creating visualizations using matplotlib/seaborn.

- **Day 5: Building a Basic Machine Learning Model**  
  - Splitting data, training models, and hyperparameter tuning.  
  - Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics.

- **Day 6: Introduction to Deep Learning**  
  - Neural network fundamentals, activation functions, loss functions, and optimizers.  
  - Introduction to TensorFlow or PyTorch.

- **Day 7: Hands-On Deep Learning**  
  - Building and training a simple neural network or CNN (e.g., on the MNIST dataset).  
  - Tracking performance through loss/accuracy curves.

- **Day 8: Domain Specialization (NLP or Computer Vision)**  
  - **Option A – NLP:** Text preprocessing, word embeddings, and sentiment analysis.  
  - **Option B – Computer Vision:** Image preprocessing, CNNs, and transfer learning.

- **Day 9: Final Project – Planning & Initial Implementation**  
  - Define and plan your end-to‑end AI project (e.g., a Movie Review Sentiment Analyzer).  
  - Set up your GitHub repository and begin coding core components.

- **Day 10: Final Project Completion & Showcase**  
  - Complete your project, refine code, add documentation, and (optionally) deploy using a web framework like Streamlit or Flask.  
  - Prepare a comprehensive portfolio entry with project description, results, and visualizations.

## Final Project

At the end of the 10‑day plan, you will have built an end‑to‑end AI project. For example, you might create a **Movie Review Sentiment Analyzer** that:

- **Data:** Utilizes a public dataset of movie reviews.  
- **Model:** Applies machine learning or deep learning to predict sentiment.  
- **Interface:** Optionally includes a simple web app for user input and model output.  
- **Documentation:** Is thoroughly documented in your GitHub repository with a detailed README and visual evidence of results.
